This repo contains an example site to see how rendering using `rstrap` instead of `bootstrap` looks like.

## What is rstrap ? Why woud I need this ?

`rstrap` is a forked of Bootstrap specially made to be used with rmarkdown for default feature. 

In most case this is not to be used. You would need this only 

* when you can't use Bootstrap own distribution for any reason, 
* but you would be able to use a fork maintained and provided by us.

If you wandered the web and stumble here instead of being pointed to this repo, then it means you probably don't need this.

## Example

See the demo site to see how it looks like: https://cderv.github.io/demo-rstrap/

This repo contains an example site to see how rendering using `rstrap` instead of `bootstrap` looks like.

## What is rstrap ? Why woud I need this ?

`rstrap` is a forked of Bootstrap specially made to be used with rmarkdown for default feature. 
In most case this is not to be used only you can't use Bootstrap own distribution for any reason, but you would be able to use a fork maintained and provided by us.

So you probably don't need this.

## Example
